## Project Idea 2 ##

Idea: Tinder for Musicians

1. What is new/original about this idea? What are related websites/apps? (Be able to answer the question: isn’t somebody already doing this?)
* 
2. Why is this idea worth doing? Why is it useful and not boring?
* 
3. What are a few major features?
* 
* 
4. What resources will be required for you to complete this project that are not already included in the class. i.e. you already have the Microsoft stack, server, database so what else would you need? Additional API’s, frameworks or platforms you’ll need to use.
* 
5. What algorithmic content is there in this project? i.e. what algorithm(s) will you have to develop or implement in order to do something central to your project idea? (Remember, this isn’t just a software engineering course, it is your CS degree capstone course!)
* 
6. Rate the topic with a difficulty rating of 1-10. One being supremely easy to implement (not necessarily short though). Ten would require the best CS students using lots of what they learned in their CS degree, plus additional independent learning, to complete successfully.
